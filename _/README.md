 RESTful Web API Design with Node.js 12, Published by Packt

This is the code repository for [RESTful Web API Design with Node.js 12 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/restful-web-api-design-with-node-js-12-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course

RESTful web APIs allow developers to create unique applications by leveraging the data on the internet. If you want to build fast-paced REST APIs and deliver large amounts of data to many users, you'll find this course essential.

In this course, you will learn to create scalable and rich RESTful applications based on the latest Node.js platform.You will learn to customize your RESTful development process using the latest NPM and understand the key principles to convert an HTTP application into RESTful-enabled applications. You will then create and test Node.js modules with automated tests, use MongoDB to store data, and get to grips with using self-descriptive URLs.

You will also use OpenAPI (Swagger) to document the API and Mocha to implement automation tests for a REST-enabled endpoint. We will explore authentication techniques to secure your application.Lastly, we will take advantage of Amazon Web Services (AWS) to deploy our APIs as microservices using Docker.

By the end of this course, you will have a solid grasp of APIs, HTTP, REST, authentication using tokens, API testing, site reliability, performance, security, and integration with cloud services.

Please note that familiarity with Node.js and Express.js (or similar), together with an understanding of Docker and CI/CD, is assumed for taking this course.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
This course is for Web Developers who want to enhance their skills to build server-side RESTful applications with Node.js.
Some knowledge of REST would be an added advantage but is not a necessity.
